# SQLStartups
Using SQL to query a dataset on the start-up industry to find what factors affect the success of a start-ups. We queried factors related to start-up members(post-secondary education, background) and factors related to the start-up itself(city, type, investors). This is the dataset we used for this project: 

**queries.sql**-This file holds all the queries we used to explore our dataset.
**cleaning.pdf**-This file contains the major steps we took to clean the data.
**schema.ddl**-This file contains schema used to organize the data.
**questions.pdf**-This file contains the questions we were trying to solve using the dataset.
